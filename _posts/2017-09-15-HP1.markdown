## summary:

These days I have finished the first book of Harry Potter series. 

Potter is a thin and skinny boy whose parents was killed by Voldemort, a bad wizard with  dark powers. 
Harry survived the Voldemort for his mother's love and determination to protect him. Since Harry'aunt was the only relatives of him in the earth, he was sent by Dumbledore -- the headmaster of Hogwarts -- to live with the family of his aunt ( the Dursleys ). 
 
 During the eleven years living with the Dursleys, Harry was treated badly as the Dursleys thought Harry was a weirdo and didn't like him at all. Harry felt extremely alone because he  neither had familes nor friends. Things changed when Harry was eleven, a gamekeeper named Hagrid from Hogwarts came to him and told him that he was able to go to Hogwarts -- the wizard school -- to learn spells. 
 
 Though unhappy as the Dursleys, Harry bought his equipments ( such as magic books, broom, herbs, an owl for corresponding and so on ) in dialog alley and come to realize another world full of wizards and witchcrafts. 
 
 He left the Dursleys and went to school. During the trip to Hogwarts Harry met some of his schoolmates and made his best friend Ron. Besides, there was one thing I forgot to say before that Potter was particularly famous in the wizards' world for he was the only one survived Voldemort and with the result of a lightning scar on his forehead. 
 
 After the jonery from platform nine and three-quarters, they arrived at Hogwarts, and before the feast started every student was sorted by the sorting hat. Harry was assigned to Gryffindor, one of the house in Hogwarts with his best friend Ron. 
 
 Then He started his life in Hogwarts learning spells and potions and other classes. In flying class, Harry showed a particular talent for flying so that Harry was invited to join the Quidditch ( a famous game in wizard world just like football in human world  ) as a seeker. Later he won the match for Gryffidor with Slytherin and the later match with another house. What's more ,there are more interesting and crazy inccidents happened during Harry's time in Hogwarts. 
 
 For example, first, the lost troll in the Hallowen evening, led Hermione in danger, while harry and Ron saved her life with the result they together defeated the big troll, which made they three best friend since this accident. Second, the finding of Erised mirror by Harry with his invisiable cloak -- he got in Chirstmas.  And third, the story about the philosopher's stone and it's maker Nicolas flamel.Forth, the inccident happened in the forbidden forest and the last that Harry and his friend Ron and Hermione trying to prevent Voldemort getting the philosopher's stone. 
 
 They got passed away the three-head dog, and Ron played a real wizard chess to get them in another door to inside, and Hermione found the right potions with her wits and knowledge about logics in another room's test, finally Harry was in time to prevent Voldemort to get the philosopher's stone.


As far as I am concerned, in book Potter shows his great bravery and courage to defeat the bad guy and his friendship with Ron and Hermione touches me much. I like Potter because he is brave and his strong will to live even though he lost his parents and lived with families who treated him badly. And I like Hermione, the smart and clever girl, who showed her supports to Harry every time. Of course I like Ron too, the boy who lived in the shadow of his excellent brothers proved himself during the simulated real wizard chess by sacrifying himself and won. 

And in the book the most impressive plot to me is the Erised mirror, which could reflect the most deepest and desperatest thing in your heart, but it is not true but just like a bubble. And Dumbledore said that it does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live. 


## and the sentences I like as follow:

* Dumbledore: **It does not to do dwell on dreams, and forget to live.**

* Hermione: **Me? Books and cleverness. There are more important things: friendship and bravery.**

* Voldemort: **There is no good and evil, there is only power and those too weak to seek it.(I dont agree)**

* Dumbledore: **It takes a great deal of courage to stand up to your enemies, but a great deal more to stand up to your friends.**

* __There are some things you can’t share without ending up liking each other, and knocking out a twelve-foot mountain troll is one of them.__

* __Only one who has nothing to lose, and everything to gain, would commit such a crime.__

* __But as Ron said, you couldn’t have everything in life.__
